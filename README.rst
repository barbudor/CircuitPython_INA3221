Introduction
============

CircuitPython driver for the Texas Instruments' INA3221 3 channels current sensor.
`Product page <http://www.ti.com/product/INA3221>`_.

2 version are available:

* normal/full		includes all constants for low-level register access + API for alarms
* lite				only basic API and no constants - use less memory

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/AdafruitCircuitPythonBusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/AdafruitCircuitPythonBundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============

see `example <https://github.com/barbudor/CircuitPythonINA3221/blob/master/examples/ina3221simpletest.py>`_.

Contributing
============

Contributions welcomed. My goal is to keep the library simple and as low on memory as possible.
